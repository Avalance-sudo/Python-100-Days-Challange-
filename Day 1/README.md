# ðŸ“˜Introduction â€“ Day  1

Day 1 marks the beginning of my commitment to the 30 Days of Python Challenge, a structured journey to deepen my understanding of Python through daily practice and reflection.odayâ€™s focus was on establishing a reliable development environment and building a strong foundation in Python syntax, data types, and basic operations. By completing a series of guided exercises,, I reinforced key concepts and prepared the groundwork for more advanced topics in the days ahead. This repository documents my progress, notes, and code as I continue to grow as a Python developer.
