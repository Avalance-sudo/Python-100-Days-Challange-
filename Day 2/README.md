## **Built in fuctions**

Python has a lot of builit in fucntions. Bulit in funtion in python is a pre-defined function that available for use without needing to import any modules or libares. Some of the most commonly used python bulit in fuctions are: print(),len(),type(),int().float(),str(),input().list(),dict(),min(),max(),sum(),sorted(),open(),file(),help(), and dir().

**Functions vs Buit in functions**

Functions:

A function is a block of code that you can name and that perfoms a certain task. You can run the block may times bu using the function name. Parameters are the variables in function that hold this data.

To use a function you vall it. When you call a function, you call it. When you call a function. you must provide values, or arguments. for each of the function parameters. When you need to change how the action is carried out, you can change the code in the function, and the improvemnt is applied everywhere.

The distrinction between functions and built in functions primarily lines in their orging and how they are made available in a program language. 

Functions (user defined functions):

- Block of code written by the programmer to perform specific tasks.
- Defined by program source code and are created to organize code, promote reusability and improve readability.
- The programmer specifies the function;s name, its parameters (input), and the operations it performs, as well as any vaule it might return (output)

To create a function, define it with the keyword def, followed by the function’s name, a set of parentheses, and a colon at the end. The function’s body contains the python code that runs when you call the function. The body has no line limit and is indented under the under the function definition. To call a function, use the function;s name followed by a set or parentheses.Here’s the output fot calling 

```python
def hello()
	"""Greer everyone."""
	print("Hello, everyone!")
```

Built in functions: 

- these are predefined functions that are part of the core language or its standard libary
- provided by languages developers and are readily available for use without needing explicit definition by the programmer.
- Built in functions typically handle common and fundamental tasks, such as input/output operations, mathematical calculations.,data type conversions and basic data manipulation.

```python
print(" This text is being displayed using a bult in python function.")
```

this will output:

```python
This text is being displayed using a built in python function.
```

Other core built in functions inclde len() for fiding the length of a container (like a list or string) and input() for receiving user entry. 

Lets practice in the python shell and start using the most common built in functions.

Practice more by using different built in functions

As we can see above, python has reserved words ( `True`, `False`, `Noneand`, `or`, `not`,`if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `pass,def`, `class`, `lambda` etc.) We do not use reserved words to decalre variables or functions.

Last practice built in functions.

## **Variables**

In python, a variable is a name attached to a piece of data. You first define a varaible, than use that name when you refer to that piece of data. Varaibles memory are able to address in which data is stored. Number at the beginign, speical character,hyphen are not aallowrd whern naming a variable. A variable can have a short name like(a,z,y,z), but more dexscropitve nmame(firstname, lastname, age, coutny) is highly recommended. 

Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you dont have to declare the kind of data a variable will represent. Dynamic languages prioritize a programmer;s time over efficient use of the processor, but the can still be fast and efficent when used properly. Satic languages proitize pricessor efficieny over a programmer’s time. 

Python varaible name rules:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a bumber
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (K-a,0-9, and_)
- Variable names are case sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirsrtName, and FIRSTNAME) are different varaibles.

Here are some exampe of vaild variabler names:

```python
firstname 
lastname 
age
country 
city
first_name
last_name 
captial_city 
_if # if we want to use reserved word as a variable
year_2025
year2005
current_year_2005
birth_year 
num1 
num2 

```

invalid variable names:

```python
first-name 
first@name
first$name
num-1
1num
```

We use underscore character after each word for a varaible containing more than one word(first_name,last_name, nightwing_is_awsome). The example below is an example of standard naming of variables, underscore is required when the variable name is more than one word. 

When we assign a cvertain data type to a variable, it is called varaible declaration. For instance in the example down below my first name is assigned to a varaible first_name. The equal sign is an assignment operator.Assigning means storing data in the variable. The equal sign in python is not equality as in mathematuics.

Variable names in python follow two main rules:

- They must contain only letters, underscores, and numbers
- They must start with a letter or underscore

Good variable names are short but descriptive:

```python
first_name= "Dick"
last_name= "Grayson"
username = "Dickgray12"
age= 22

```

A varabile can hold a small piece of information, or it can hold many gigabytes of data.

```python
# Variables in python
first_name= 'Nightwing'
last_name= 'Grayson'
county = 'USA'
city= 'Gotham'
age= 22
is_married = False 
skills = ['acrobatic','martial arts abilities,' 'world-class detective skills']
person_info={
							'firstname': 'Nightwing',
							'lastname': 'Grayson'
							'country': 'USA'
							'city': 'Gotam'
						}

```

The print function takes unlimed number of arguments. An argument is a value which we can be passed or put isnde the function parenthesis, see the example below.

Example:

```python
print('Hello, World!') # the texrt hello, world is an argument 
prit('Hello ',',',' 'World', '!') # it can take multiple arguments, four argument have been passed 
print(len('Hello, World!;)) # it tkaes only one argument  
```

Let us printy and also find the legnth of the varaibles decalred at the top:

```python
# Printing the values stored in the variables
print('First name:', first_name)
print('first name length: ', len(first_name))
print('Last name length: ', len(last_name))
print('Contry: ', country)
print('City', city)
print('Age',age)
print('Married: ', is_married)
print('skills:', skills)
print('Person infromation: ', person_info)
```

Declaring Multiple Variable in line

Multiple variables can also be declared in one line:

Example:

```python
fist_name,last_name,country,age, is_married ='Nightwing,' 'Batman', 'Red Hood', 25, True
print(first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married)
print('Last name: ', last_name)
print('Country: ', country)
print('Age: ', age)
print('Married: ', is_married)
```

Getting user input using the input() bulit in function. Let us assign the data we get from a user into first_name and age variables.

Example:

```python
first_name = input('What is your name')
age= input('How old are you?')

print(first_name)
print(Age)
```

## *Data types*

There are seveal data types in python. To identify the data type we use the type built in function.  Data types refers to the darta structures youre using or the kind of information stored in those data structures.

## ***Checking Data types and casting***

check data types: To check the data types of certain data/ varible we use the type example: 

```python
#Different python data types 
# Declare variables with various data types 

first_name='Nightwing' #str
last_name ='Grayson' # str
country= 'USA' #str
City= ' Gotham' #str
age= 25 # int, it is not his real age 

# Printing out types
print(type('Dick;)) # str
print(type(first_namer)) # str
print(type(10)) #int
print(type(3.14)) #float
print(type(1+1j)) #complex 
print(type(True)) #bool
print(Type([1,2,3,4])) #list
print(Type({'name': ' Grayson'})) #dict
print(type((1,2)) #tuple
print(Type(zip([1,2],[3,4]))) #zip
```

Casting: Converting one data type to another data type.We use int(),float(),str(), list, set, when we do arithmetic operations string number should first be converted to int or float otherwise it will return an error. If we concatenate (joining two or more sequences(such as strings, lists or tuples ) to create a longer sequence) a number with a string, the number should be first converted to a string. 

Examples:

```python
# int to float 
num_int-==10 
print('num_int',num_int) #10 
num_float = float(num_int) 
print('num_float:', num_float) #10.0 

#Float to int 
gravity =9.81
print(int(gravity)) #9 

# int to str
num_int = 10
print(num_int)                  # 10
num_str = str(num_int)
print(num_str)                  # '10'

# str to int or float
num_str = '10.6'
num_float = float(num_str)
print('num_float', float(num_str))  # 10.6
num_int = int(num_float)
print('num_int', int(num_int))      # 10

# str to list
first_name = 'Nightwing'
print(first_name)               # 'Nightwing'
first_name_to_list = list(first_name)
print(first_name_to_list)            # ['A', 's', 'a', 'b', 'e', 'n', 'e', 'h'
```

## Numbers

Number data types 

1. Integers: Integer(negative,zero and postive) numbers example… -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,
2. Floating point number (decimal  numbers) example ..-3.5,-2.25,-1.0,0.0,1.1,2.2,3.5…
3. Complex number: 1+j,2+4j,1-1j
